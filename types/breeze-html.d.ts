/**
 * Type declarations for BreezeHtml — the Rust-backed cheerio-compatible API
 * injected into every plugin runtime.
 *
 * This is a minimal, read-only subset of the cheerio API that covers the
 * operations used by Breeze plugins.
 *
 * Existing plugins that import from `"cheerio"` can drop that dependency and
 * use `const load = BreezeHtml.load;` directly. Copy this declaration file into
 * the plugin project and reference it from the global type declarations so
 * TypeScript knows about `BreezeHtml` and the returned selection types.
